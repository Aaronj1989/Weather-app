program starts 

checks location for current scene

if location label = "Location" // do nothing until the user searches for a 
location.


search for location // returns forecast for that location

saves the forecast to the database and replace default labels

and puts the gif representing current conditions next to current condition label


------------------------


program starts and scene has location saved to it (location label != "Location")

check if its current day (compared to the last "current day")
if it is current day just set the last 5 forecasts from database to the scene
and a gif representing the current condition

if its a new day, update everything(labels and table). 


if they decide to change the scene, They'll get a prompt asking if they want
to overwrite the scene. if yes overwrite and save to database. 
(high,low,today,tonight and current) will most likely be affected. 
if locations the same do nothing.
